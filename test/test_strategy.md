# General testing rules

- Tests should be done for 1d, 2d and 3d examples
- Tests should be done for single data, vector data and tuple data
- Tests should be done for `PointPattern`s, `MarkedPointPattern`s and `GriddedData`

## Things to remember to test
- Should check that if you pass an estimate in, its memory is not modified after computation.
